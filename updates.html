    <p>
      Welcome to SF!
      Here is a
      <a href="https://goo.gl/xMhV3U" target="_blank">map</a>
      (or <a href="/things-to-do-in-sf.pdf" target="_blank">printable PDF</a>)
      of the few critical places we will be this weekend
      PLUS our favorite sites off the 49-Mile Scenic Drive.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49-Mile_Scenic_Drive" target="_blank">The 49-Mile Scenic Drive</a>
      is a designated scenic road tour highlighting much of San Francisco, CA.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may have noticed that the official 49-Mile Scenic Drive sign has a big influence on our wedding theme.
      We were inspired since these signs are all over Dogpatch, where Ian used to live.

      The wedding ceremony is in a
      <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XFCkotpCy3J2">park</a>,
      so please consider this in your selection of footwear.
      If you are wearing heels, consider getting heel protectors.
      Also, the park is a popular play area for dogs, so keep your eyes peeled when walking.
