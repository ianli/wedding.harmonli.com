      A <i>meet cute</i> is the scene in a movie in which the romantic couple meets for the first time.
      Coincidentally, our meet cute happened in Los Angeles, the land of movie stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the summer of 2013. My good friend Courtney invited me to travel with her to attend a 3-day swing dancing workshop in Los Angeles.
      I had just taken a few months of swing dancing lessons, so I was eager to go.
      After the first day of workshop classes, we went to an evening dance with hundreds of other attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the evening, a handsome man greeted me with a huge smile and asked me to dance.
      He held my hand as we waited for the music to start and he said, "I think I may have danced with you before."
      I told him it was possible, but I live in the San Francisco area.
      He mentioned he was too.
      We realized we likely had danced together at his regular dance place <i>Cat's Corner</i> in downtown SF, which I went to every now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our dance, Ian took me over to meet his friends and I introduced his friends to mine.
      We all spent much of the weekend together and I remember feeling that the best part of the trip was knowing we had new friends.
      Turned out, I found out later that Ian felt the same way about us.
      When we got home from the trip, I we started spending more and more time together and I spent days asking Courtney if she thought he liked me. Thankfully, some weeks later, he told me he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so grateful for this amazing man, Ian. He has brought me so much joy, laughter, warmth (Sriracha!), and love. Whether we share dances, half-marathons, crafts or pancakes, he has a way of making me feel so complete and at home, no matter where we are.

    <h2>The Proposal</h2>

      I enjoy watching movies a lot.
      So when I planned how to propose to Beth,
      I wanted a movie to be the theme of the proposal.
      I picked the movie <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i> because that was one of Beth's favorite movies.
      The plan I came up with was this:
      Beth and I would spend a whole day in San Francisco acting out scenes from Breakfast at Tiffany's.
      Beth would be Holly Golightly and I would be Paul Varjak.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whole day affair was a big clue that a proposal was coming,
      so I needed a ploy to make it unpredictable when I would pop the question.
      In multiple scenes in the movie, a toy ring from a box of Cracker Jacks was a prominent prop.
      I used this as a decoy for the real ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day of the proposal, Beth and I went to the city.
      Our first stop was the storefront of the Tiffany's store in Union Square, which was similar to the first scene in the movie (the movie was set in New York City).
      I handed Beth a gift which contained two copies of the movie script and gave her a short explanation of the plan for the day.
      From there, we proceeded to go to different locations in the city while acting out scenes from the movie.
      In each location, I gave Beth a surprise gift that contains a prop for the current scene.
      I gave her a cat figurine and eye mask at our hotel,
      a box of Cracker Jacks with a ring inside at Yerba Buena Gardens,
      a copy of Nine Lives by Paul Varjak at the library,
      and toy masks at a souvenir shop in downtown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last destination was a French restaurant called Jeanne D'Arc.
      When we arrived, a dozen roses was waiting on the table.
      At this point, I was so nervous and teary-eyed from excitement.
      We had difficulties continuing the script because the waiter interrupted us multiple times to ask for our orders: water, wine, appetizer, main entree.
      When we reached the main entree, we finally had a block of time to finish the script.
      At the end, I told Beth, "The movie should have ended with Paul presenting the Cracker Jack ring to Holly and asking
      'Will you marry me?'"
      Then I opened a navy blue ring box with a real ring in it and waited for Beth's response.
      After a few seconds, I asked, "Is that a yes?" She replied, "You haven't even asked me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'oh! I was so nervous that I thought I had asked the question <i>to</i> Beth.
      I apologized, then said the question again. This time, directly to her.
      She answered, "Yes!"
