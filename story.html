      In the summer of 2013, my good friend Courtney invited me to travel with her to attend a 3-day swing dancing workshop in Los Angeles.
      I had just taken a few months of swing dancing lessons, so I was eager to go.
      After the first day of workshop classes, we went to an evening dance with hundreds of other attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the evening, a handsome man greeted me with a huge smile and asked me to dance.
      He held my hand as we waited for the music to start and he said, "I think I may have danced with you before."
      I told him it was possible, but I live in the San Francisco area.
      He mentioned he was too.
      We realized we likely had danced together at his regular dance place <i>Cat’s Corner</i> in downtown SF, which I went to every now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our dance, Ian took me over to meet his friends and I introduced his friends to mine.
      We all spent much of the weekend together and I remember feeling that the best part of the trip was knowing we had new friends.
      Turned out, I found out later that Ian felt the same way about us.
      When we got home from the trip, I we started spending more and more time together and I spent days asking Courtney if she thought he liked me. Thankfully, some weeks later, he told me he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so grateful for this amazing man, Ian. He has brought me so much joy, laughter, warmth (Sriracha!), and love. Whether we share dances, half-marathons, crafts or pancakes, he has a way of making me feel so complete and at home, no matter where we are.

      I knew that one of Beth's favorite movies is <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>.
      In the movie, a Cracker Jack ring appears multiple times.
      We spent a whole day in San Francisco acting out scenes from one of Beth’s favorite movies, Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Every scene had a surprise gift that served as a prop: a cat figurine, a music box that plays Moon River, a Cracker Jack box with a ring inside, and toy masks. Instead of the original movie ending, I proposed to her and she said "Yes!"&mdash;a sweet and memorable ending to an exciting day!
