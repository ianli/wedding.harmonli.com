      A <i>meet cute</i> is the scene in a movie in which the romantic couple meets for the first time.
      Coincidentally, our meet cute happened in Los Angeles, the land of movie stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the summer of 2013. My good friend Courtney invited me to travel with her to attend a 3-day swing dancing workshop in Los Angeles.
      I had just taken a few months of swing dancing lessons, so I was eager to go.
      After the first day of workshop classes, we went to an evening dance with hundreds of other attendees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time in the evening, a handsome man greeted me with a huge smile and asked me to dance.
      He held my hand as we waited for the music to start and he said, "I think I may have danced with you before."
      I told him it was possible, but I live in the San Francisco area.
      He mentioned he was too.
      We realized we likely had danced together at his regular dance place <i>Cat's Corner</i> in downtown SF, which I went to every now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our dance, Ian took me over to meet his friends and I introduced his friends to mine.
      We all spent much of the weekend together and I remember feeling that the best part of the trip was knowing we had new friends.
      Turned out, I found out later that Ian felt the same way about us.
      When we got home from the trip, I we started spending more and more time together and I spent days asking Courtney if she thought he liked me. Thankfully, some weeks later, he told me he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm so grateful for this amazing man, Ian. He has brought me so much joy, laughter, warmth (Sriracha!), and love. Whether we share dances, half-marathons, crafts or pancakes, he has a way of making me feel so complete and at home, no matter where we are.

    <h2>The Proposal</h2>

    <p>
      I knew that one of Beth's favorite movies is <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's</i>,
      so I thought I'd make the movie the theme of the proposal.
      In the movie, a Cracker Jack ring appears multiple times.
      I thought this fact would make it a surprise when I would pop the question.
      At any point, that the Cracker Jack ring might appear, I could pop the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was my plan: I printed two copies of the movie script.
      We then spent the whole day in San Francisco acting out scenes from the movie.
      I was Paul Varjak and Beth was Holly Golightly.
      For each scene in the movie, we went to a different place in the city
      and I gave Beth a surprise gift that contains a prop for that scene.
      A cat figurine, a music box that plays Moon River, a Cracker Jack box with a ring inside, and toy masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our last destination where we finished the script was a French restaurant called Jean D'Arc.
      When we arrived, a dozen roses was on the table.
      At this point, I was nervous and teary-eyed from excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to time the ending of the script because the waiter had to interrupt us multiple times to ask for our order.
      When we reached the main entree, we hurried towards the end of the script.
      At the end, I told Beth, "The movie should have ended with Paul presenting the Cracker Jack ring to Holly and asking
      'Will you marry me?'"
      I opened a navy blue ring box with a real ring in it and waited for Beth's response.
      I asked, "Is that a yes?" She replied, "You haven't even asked me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'oh! I was so nervous that I thought I had asked the question <i>to</i> Beth.
      I apologized, then said the question again. This time, directly to her.
      She answered, "Yes!"
