      I guess most people are always interested in how we met. Many of you have probably already heard the story, but here it goes...the official story. From one perspective. I had just gotten into swing dancing and a good friend, Courtney, asked me to travel to LA with her and a friend to attend a 3 day swing dance workshop in LA. After the very first full day of classes, there was an “open- dance” where we could dance with people and practice what we had learned. Before I knew it, I was greeted with a huge smile and a handsome man held out his hand and asked me to dance. He continued to hold my hand in his as we waited for the music to start and he said,”I think I may have danced with you before.” I told him it was possible but I was from San Francisco area. He mentioned he was too and we realized we likely had danced together on a Wednesday at his regular dance place, “Cat’s corner” in SF, a place I went to every now and again. After our dance, Ian took me over to meet his friends and I introduced his friends to mine. We all spent much of the weekend together and I remember feeling that the best part of the trip was knowing we had new friends. Turned out, I found out later that Ian felt the same way about us. When we got home from the trip, I we started spending more and more time together and I spent hours (maybe days) asking Courtney if she thought he liked me.  Thankfully, some weeks later, he told me he did.  I’m so grateful for this amazing man, Ian. He has brought me so much joy, laughter, warmth (Sriracha!) and love. Whether we share dances, half-marathons, crafts or pancakes, he has a way of making me feel so complete and at home, no matter where we are.
